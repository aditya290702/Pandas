## Overview
This project showcases my experience in working with **Pandas**, a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. In this project, I have practiced various Pandas operations such as data reading, manipulation, and analysis. Additionally, I have created a quiz using a **custom CSV file**.

## Features
- **Pandas Practice**: Explored fundamental operations such as:
  - Reading data from CSV files
  - Data cleaning and manipulation
  - Grouping and aggregating data
  - Handling missing values
  - Merging and concatenating DataFrames
  - Filtering data

- **Custom Quiz**: 
  - Designed a quiz using a custom CSV file.
  - The CSV file contains a list of questions, answers, and other quiz-related information.
  - The quiz reads data from the CSV file and generates questions dynamically.
